# install.sh â€” Symlink dotfiles into your HOME directory
# -----------------------------------------------------
# This script creates (or updates) symbolic links for your dotfiles
# (.bashrc, .bash_profile, .bash_aliases, .nanorc) from the repository
# root into your home directory.
#
# It will:
# 1. Determine the absolute path to the dotfiles directory.
# 2. Loop over each file in the FILES array.
# 3. Back up any existing non-symlinked files in $HOME.
# 4. Create or overwrite the symlink pointing from $HOME to the repo.
# 5. Print progress for each step.
